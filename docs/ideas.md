# CRUDify + Next-Admin: Classification & Explanation

## **What Type of Application is CRUDify?**

Your application, **CRUDify + Next-Admin**, falls into multiple categories, but here’s the best way to classify it based on how it works:

---

## **1️⃣ Primary Category: API-Driven Admin Panel**
Your system is primarily an **API-Driven Admin Panel**, meaning it **provides an admin interface for managing data, but the UI is separate from the backend**. It enables users to interact with data via a frontend (**Next-Admin**) while the backend (**CRUDify**) handles data operations.

### **Similar to:** 
- **RailsAdmin** (but API-only)
- **ActiveAdmin** (but decoupled)
- **Strapi Admin Panel** (but Rails-based)

---

## **2️⃣ Secondary Category: Headless CMS (in a way)**
Since your system exposes **metadata and data APIs**, it shares characteristics with a **Headless CMS**. However, it is not a full-fledged CMS because:
- It does **not** focus on structured content management (like WordPress, Strapi, or Contentful).
- It is **more of a database admin tool** rather than a content repository.

If you add features like **custom content types, rich-text editors, and media management**, then it could become more of a **Headless CMS**.

### **Similar to:** 
- **Strapi** (but CRUDify is Rails-based)
- **Directus** (but no built-in UI)
- **KeystoneJS** (if extended)

---

## **3️⃣ SaaS Admin Panel (Future Potential)**
If you extend **CRUDify + Next-Admin** into a **multi-tenant system**, where users can host/administer different applications **as a service**, then it would start to resemble a **SaaS admin panel**.

### **Similar to:**
- **Forest Admin** (which connects to multiple backends)
- **Retool** (if it allows building admin dashboards)

---

## **Conclusion: What Should You Call It?**
- **"API-Driven Admin Panel"** → Best fit for now.
- **"Headless Admin Panel"** → If you want a buzzword-friendly name.
- **"Admin API for Rails Apps"** → If targeting Rails users.

If your goal is **purely admin management of Rails apps via an API**, stick with **API-Driven Admin Panel**. But if you plan to extend it into a **structured content system**, it could move toward being a **Headless CMS**.

---

## **Bonus: How Should You Market It?**
If you're planning to market **CRUDify**, here’s how you could describe it:

> **CRUDify** is an **API-driven admin panel** for **Rails 8.0 applications**, providing metadata and data APIs that integrate with **Next-Admin**, a frontend client. Unlike traditional admin dashboards, CRUDify allows you to manage multiple Rails apps via a single admin panel using a secure API key.
